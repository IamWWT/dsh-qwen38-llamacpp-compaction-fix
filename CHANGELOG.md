# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (2026-XX-XX)

### 改名:去掉 `-fix` 尾缀

- **改名**:包名 `dsh-qwen38-gateway-compaction-fix` → `dsh-qwen38-gateway-compaction`
  (设置命名空间同步改为 `qwen38-gateway-compaction`;仓库更名为
  IamWWT/dsh-qwen38-gateway-compaction)。更名原因:插件本身是"压缩修复"能力,
  `-fix` 尾缀与"修复/修 bug"语义重复,且与 `dsh-compaction-basic` 等内置包对齐
  (它们都不带 `-fix` 尾缀)。
- 设置覆盖段:~/.dsh*/settings.yaml 里的 `qwen38-gateway-compaction-fix:` 段需
  手动改名为 `qwen38-gateway-compaction:`(旧命名空间不再被识别)。
- cordis id / 设置命名空间 / 日志前缀同步更名;`/qwen38-compact`、
  `/qwen38-new-context` 两个手动命令不变。

## 1.0.3 (2026-09-09)

### 四个内置 preset 的适用性:代码级验证 + 文档

- 新增 `docs/preset-applicability.md`:适用性矩阵(standard/ptc/cordis 有自动压缩,
  minimal 没有)、代码路径证据(host 级 fetch 包装 / `llm/stream` / 命令注入;
  pi-ai 每次 stream 新建 openai client → `getDefaultFetch()` 取全局 fetch)、
  运行时实证(aiops 会话 56 次 400 证明 fetch 层真实生效)与边界说明。
- 新增 `test/preset-applicability.mjs`(10 条断言):无压缩引擎时仍 apply 成功且只注册
  `llm/stream`;手动命令照常注册;全局 fetch 被包装;允许模型压缩体被改写、白名单外
  逐字节透传;llama.cpp/NInfer 引擎分流;compaction 打标与非 compaction 透传。
- README 增加"适用 preset"小节并链接该文档。

## 1.0.2 (2026-09-09)

### 去掉重复的设置入口

- 删除 v0.3.0 起额外注册的左侧导航独立条目(`settings.section` /
  「Qwen3.8 压缩修复」);插件设置现在只保留 **设置 → 插件 → 插件配置** 的卡片,
  与所有内置插件一致,不再重复出现两处。
- `/qwen38-compact` / `/qwen38-new-context` 手动命令说明移入卡片正文(展开可见),
  不因去掉独立页面而丢失。
- README 同步为单一入口说明;`nav` locale 键与 `Qwen38Section` 组件移除;
  client 冒烟测试断言改为"只注册一个 slot"。

## 1.0.1 (2026-09-09)

### 设置页展示对齐内置插件

- 插件配置卡改为**可折叠卡片**:头部按钮 = 插件名 + 描述 + chevron,展开后才渲染
  控件,保存落定后自动收起(与内置 `PluginCard` 同一套交互);收起时若有未保存修改,
  头部用 `Tag` 提示。
- 卡片外观复用平台主题变量(`--dsw-alias-bg-layer-*` / `--dsw-alias-border-*` /
  `--dsw-alias-label-*`),字号与分隔线对齐内置插件(hint 12px tertiary、分组标题
  12.5px secondary、0.5px hairline),深浅色主题下都不突兀。
- 专用左侧设置区(设置 → 「Qwen3.8 压缩修复」)的标题/描述同步自然化。

## 1.0.0 (2026-09-09)

### 改名 + NInfer 引擎支持

- **改名**:包名 `dsh-qwen38-llamacpp-compaction-fix` → `dsh-qwen38-gateway-compaction-fix`
  (设置命名空间同步改为 `qwen38-gateway-compaction-fix`;仓库更名为
  IamWWT/dsh-qwen38-gateway-compaction-fix)。更名原因:插件不再只服务 llama.cpp。
- **新增 NInfer 引擎支持**:新增 `ninModels` 配置(默认 `[]`)——列入其中的模型由
  NInfer 网关服务,自动跳过 `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` 合并(NInfer 对该
  字段返回 400 `chat_template_option_not_supported`),思考关闭改走
  `reasoning_effort` wire 字段;采样/max_tokens 下限/分片救援对两种引擎一视同仁。
  修复"llama.cpp 插件误用于 NInfer 模型导致所有压缩 400 失败"的故障。
- 基础层默认 `models` 增加 `qwen3.8-27b`、`ninModels: [qwen3.8-27b]`、
  `chunking.contextWindows` 增加 `qwen3.8-27b: 369144`(均可被 settings.yaml 覆盖)。
- 设置卡(client)文案更新为双引擎描述。

## 0.5.0

## 0.5.0 (2026-09-06)

### Added — `/qwen38-new-context` hard-reset command (the researched Codex third feature, now implemented)

- **New global command `/qwen38-new-context`**: drops the session's visible history from the model context in seconds with **zero LLM calls and zero token cost**, writing a fixed "new window" marker instead of an LLM summary. The whole manual transaction (idle check, range selection, commit protocol, flush, rollback) stays the official `dsh-compaction-basic` implementation — only the summarizer is swapped for a template via its documented subclass hook (`summarize`, unmarked-SummaryResult variant).
- **Independent switch** `command.newContext.enabled` (default on), separate from `command.enabled`; web settings card gains a third labeled switch (已启用/已停用) with tooltip, and the left-nav section's command hint now documents both commands.
- README: feature 3 in the intro, dedicated usage section, settings.yaml keys, research-notes section updated from "research only" to implemented.

### Fixed (both found by live e2e during this release)

- **Engine construction precedence bug**: `new makeHardResetEngine(Engine)(ctx, cfg)` parses as `new (makeHardResetEngine(Engine)(ctx, cfg))` — the returned class was invoked *without* `new`, so on first use both manual commands failed with "Class constructor … cannot be invoked without 'new'". Now constructed via an intermediate binding; regression-guarded in smoke.
- **Service-registration collision in standard-preset sessions**: `CompactionEngine` hard-codes `super(ctx, "compaction")`, so any extra engine instance collided with the built-in compaction service (or would shadow it). Manual engines are now constructed on a detached context view that no-ops `reflect.provide` — they run purely through their instances and never touch the registry, in both minimal and standard sessions; regression-guarded in smoke.

### Tests

- smoke: 37 → 58 cases (dual-command registration + per-command gating, hard-reset engine behavior, the two regression guards above).
- Verified end-to-end on a sandbox home and on the live source-build instance: reset of a ~2.3k-token history completed in ~4s with no LLM call; strict amnesia check (exact-wording recall) confirms pre-reset history is gone from the model context while the event log on disk stays intact.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-05)

### Changed (settings UI, browser half only)

- **Enum dropdown for `wireReasoning`**: the reasoning_effort value is now a
  `<select>` (none / low / medium / high / “不写该字段”) instead of free text —
  no more typos in an enumerated field.
- **Hover tooltips with explicit dependency labels**: every field label carries a
  `title` tooltip stating whether the field is independent (“独立项”) or which
  switch gates it (e.g. “依赖「超大对话分片救援」开启”). The only two
  dependency chains are: `models` (root — empty disables the whole policy) and
  the rescue master switch (gates context windows + the four chunk tuning
  fields).
- **Rescue-gated dimming**: when the rescue switch is off, the per-model
  context-window rows and the four chunking advanced fields are greyed out and
  disabled (values kept, just inert), with an orange “depends on rescue being
  on” note — the UI now shows the dependency structure instead of hiding it.
- README: FAQ (when `/qwen38-compact` can be triggered; whether anything runs
  automatically), UI dependency documentation, and a research-notes section.

### Added

- `docs/codex-token-budget-hard-rollover.md`: verified research on Codex's
  token-budget + hard context rollover direction (rust-v0.153.0 release notes,
  PR #29743, PR #39827 — all checked online) and the design sketch for a
  candidate third feature, `/qwen38-new-context` (instant zero-LLM hard reset,
  plus a handoff-note variant). Research only; not implemented.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-05)

### Added

- **`/qwen38-compact` manual compaction command**: type it in any session's
  composer to compact that session's history into a summary checkpoint right
  now. This is the unstick path for conversations over the model's context
  window in presets without a built-in compaction engine (e.g. minimal),
  where no automatic compaction ever fires and the preset selector only
  applies to new sessions. The command reuses the official
  `dsh-compaction-basic` transaction (`BasicCompactionEngine` with
  `auto: false`, so no pressure hooks are registered) — its summarization
  call flows through `llm/stream {purpose:'compaction'}` and therefore gets
  every wire-layer treatment (thinking off, sampling params, max_tokens
  floor, tools strip) plus the chunked map-reduce rescue for oversized
  prompts. Registered as a global command via
  `ctx.inject(['commands','tokenMeter','sessions'])`, so it is visible in
  every session regardless of preset; friendly failure text on busy /
  missing-engine / no-summary outcomes, transaction rolls back untouched.
  Disable with `command.enabled: false`.
- **Dedicated settings section**: the plugin now registers its own left-nav
  row (Settings → “Qwen3.8 压缩修复”, order 20) in addition to the
  plugins-tab card — same live scope, plus a scope banner (“all parameters
  apply only to compaction/title auxiliary calls; normal conversation is
  untouched”) and the `/qwen38-compact` usage hint.
- **UI redesign** (client.js): boolean fields are now labeled on/off pill
  switches with explicit “已启用/已停用” state text (no more mystery
  checkboxes); per-model context-window rows (one row per id in `models`,
  so a changed `-c` is unambiguous which model it belongs to); consistent
  label-column alignment and grouped sections (基础设置 / 高级参数).
- README: “上下文窗口长度变了怎么办” guide (when/what to change, how to
  verify the live n_ctx via `GET /v1/models`, safe-fail semantics),
  `/qwen38-compact` usage section, and a corrected stuck-session recipe
  (preset switching does NOT work mid-session — use the command).

### Fixed

- **Compaction summarization produced no text on Qwen3.8 / llama.cpp build
  10798**: dsh's compaction prompt includes the conversation's `tools`
  schemas (KV-cache prefix affinity). With tools present AND thinking off,
  this model answers with an empty-content tool call instead of a summary —
  measured: tools+thinking-off → empty; tools+thinking-on → works;
  no-tools+thinking-off → works. Both `rewriteCompactionBody` and
  `rewriteTitleBody` now strip `tools`/`tool_choice` from matched bodies.
  (The summarization prompt itself never references tool names, so nothing
  is lost.)

### Verified end-to-end

- Sandbox minimal-preset session: `/qwen38-compact` recognized as a command,
  compacted 7 history items (~3047 tokens) into a checkpoint; the model then
  answered a follow-up question that only makes sense with the pre-compaction
  context (checkpoint survived).
- Real instance (the user's dsh web, port 3082): the stuck veinmap session at
  **262519 tokens > 262144 window** compacted via one command — 130 nodes
  (~49.5K tokens) → a 10.1K-character Chinese checkpoint, context usage back
  to 8%, conversation resumed immediately.

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-05)

### Added

- **Web settings card** (browser half): the plugin now ships a self-contained
  client bundle (`client.js`, no build step) declared through `package.json`
  `dsh.client` + the `./client` export. In dsh web it renders as the
  “Qwen3.8 llama.cpp 压缩修复” card under Settings → Plugins → Plugin
  configuration, editing every config key (model ids, context window,
  thinking-off / wire-reasoning toggles, max_tokens floor, rescue switch,
  and an advanced section with all sampling + chunk tuning fields). Saving
  writes `settings.yaml` live; the “overrides default” badge stages a
  reset-to-default (unset) op on save — same staging model as the built-in
  cards. Chinese + English locale.
- `test/client-smoke.mjs`: loads the client bundle in a VM with a stubbed
  module loader, drives the Cordis surface (locale registration, slot
  entry), renders the card through a minimal React renderer, and exercises
  edit / save / invalid-block / reset-unset / discard against a fake
  settings scope.
- README: web-card usage section plus a troubleshooting section for
  already-stuck conversations (minimal preset ships no compaction engine;
  pi-ai rejects any `reasoningEffort` — including `off` — for models that
  declare no reasoning capability, which is why this plugin's effort layer
  stays silent for undeclared models and relies on the wire layers).

### Verified end-to-end (real dsh web instance + headless Chrome via CDP)

- card renders with live values from the real settings scope;
- UI edit → save writes `settings.yaml` (`maxTokensFloor: 16000` observed on
  disk); badge → save removes the key again (unset path), leaving no residue.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-05)

### Fixed

- **Boot failure on source builds**: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` has two API
generations — npm releases (0.1.1-rc.x) export the free functions
  `installSettingsSection`/`settingsNamespace`, while newer source-tree
  releases (>= 0.1.3) expose `ctx.settings.installSection(...)` on the service
  and export no free functions. The static named import crashed plugin loading
  in source builds ("does not provide an export named
  'installSettingsSection'"). The module now imports dsh-settings dynamically
  and supports both generations: new API via the optional
  `ctx.inject(["settings"], cb)` scope, legacy free function as fallback,
  schema-resolved composition entry as the final fallback (no settings service
  mounted). Works unchanged in npm and source builds.
- Test coverage for both settings API generations added to `test/smoke.mjs`
  (41 cases total).

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-05)

Initial release. Local plugin for llama.cpp gateways (tuned on Unsloth Studio +
Qwen3.8-27B GGUF, llama.cpp build 10798).

### R1 — thinking off for auxiliary calls only

- `llm/stream` waterfall layer: stamps `reasoningEffort: "off"` on calls whose
  `purpose` is in `purposes` and whose `options.model` is in `models`; resolves
  the model's offered efforts with preference order configured → `off` → `low`.
- HTTP compaction-body layer: process-global `fetch` wrapper writes, on bodies
  carrying the dsh-compaction-basic instruction signature for an allowed model:
  - `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking = false` (merged; other template kwargs preserved),
  - `reasoning_effort` set to the configured wire value (default `"none"`),
  - the configured non-thinking sampling entries (`temperature/top_p/top_k/min_p/presence_penalty/repetition_penalty`, default Qwen3's recommended non-thinking set),
  - a raise-only `max_tokens`/`max_completion_tokens` floor (default 16384) restoring the output budget when pi-ai's client-side context clamp collapses it.
- HTTP session-title layer: same two thinking-off wire fields on bodies carrying
  the dsh-session-title-llm system-prompt signature for an allowed model; the
  title plugin's own `max_tokens` is left untouched.
- Model allow-list (`models`, default `["Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF"]`) enforced at every
  layer; empty list disables the whole policy. Signature gates use structural
  prefix matches (compaction instruction must start the final user message; the
  title prompt must start a system/developer message), so conversation turns
  that merely quote either signature pass through untouched.
- Settings section `qwen38-gateway-compaction-fix:` in `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`
  overrides the bundle config live, without a restart.

### R2 — oversized-conversation compaction rescue (chunked map-reduce)

Fixes the "chatted on a 1M-context model, switched to a 250k-context local
model, now 'cannot compact'" case: dsh-compaction-basic's single-shot
summarization cannot fit a conversation larger than the target window.

- HTTP rescue layer: after the compaction-body rewrite, estimates the prompt
  tokens (CJK-conservative heuristic: ~1 token/CJK char, chars/4 otherwise,
  1024 per image block, `tools` schemas included). When it exceeds
  `chunkRatio × contextWindows[model]` and chunking is enabled for that model,
  the original request is NOT forwarded; instead:
  - the message range is split into consecutive slices (leading system/developer
    messages re-sent per slice and charged to the budget; a `tool`-role message
    never starts a slice; an over-budget single message is head/tail-truncated
    for internal calls only — the durable surface is untouched);
  - each slice is summarized sequentially (non-streaming, thinking off, sampling
    applied, `max_tokens = chunkMaxTokens`, the conversation's own compaction
    instruction appended verbatim);
  - partial checkpoints are merged in a final call (`mergeMaxTokens`), with an
    automatic two-level hierarchical merge when even the flat merge would not fit;
  - the merged checkpoint is returned to dsh as a standard OpenAI response: SSE
    stream with keep-alive pings (15s) when the original request was streaming,
    plain JSON otherwise.
- Fail-open semantics everywhere: unknown model window / more slices than
  `maxChunks` / unparseable body → forward the original untouched; mid-flight
  failure (after one retry per call) → stream ends with EMPTY content, which
  dsh-compaction-basic rejects cleanly and the conversation surface is preserved
  — the same safe outcome as today's overflow.

### Verification

- `test/smoke.mjs`: 37 gating/estimation/slicing/body-shaping cases pass.
- `test/rescue-e2e.mjs`: 29 end-to-end cases with a mock transport pass (slice
  fan-out, merge call, thinking-off carry-over, tools dropped, SSE shape).
- Live gateway checks (llama.cpp build 10798 via Unsloth Studio :8880): default
  requests think (non-empty `reasoning_content`); both
  `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` and `reasoning_effort="none"`
  independently suppress thinking (streaming and non-streaming, easy and hard
  prompts); all six sampling fields are accepted without error.
